A new Flutter project.

Architecture and Third-Party Packages
It is built using Flutter for a smooth, cross-platform mobile experience. The app structure keeps things modular and maintainable.

Key Packages Used:
hive_flutter: For local data storage. Hive is lightweight and fast, perfect for saving app data without a heavy database setup.

uuid: Generates unique IDs for objects, which helps in managing data like items or records without conflicts.

cupertino_icons: Adds iOS-style icons for a better user interface look and feel.

flutter_lints: Ensures clean and consistent code by enforcing best practices and linting rules.

build_runner: Supports automated code generation, which helps keep the codebase cleaner and easier to manage during development.

This setup was chosen to balance performance, simplicity, and scalability while using proven community packages to speed up development.
